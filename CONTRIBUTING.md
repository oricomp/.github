# Contributing

**OriComp** is meant to be a personal project. The whole idea is to create an 
entire computer system designed by one person. That being said, bug reports
(and fixes) are more than welcome. If a new feature is needed, feel free to
create an issue for it in the relevant repo or in 
[oricomp](https://github.com/oricomp/oricomp).

If you have a bug fix, I will review, approve and merge the PR. Please allow
up to a week for this. After that, comment on the PR to remind me.

Feel free to fork any repo and make your own changes, but it is unlikely that
they will be merged back into the **OriComp** project.
